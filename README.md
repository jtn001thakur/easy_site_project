## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization Flow

- User registers via `/api/auth/register`
- Password is hashed using bcrypt
- User logs in via `/api/auth/login`
- JWT token is generated and returned
- Token is sent in `Authorization` header
- Auth middleware verifies token
- User data is attached to `req.user`
- Role middleware checks ADMIN access
- Ownership check ensures only creator can modify product

---

## 📦 Product Rules

- Only ADMIN can create products
- Only creator ADMIN can update/delete products
- Each ADMIN sees only their own products
